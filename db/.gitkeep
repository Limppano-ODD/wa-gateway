# Database Directory

This directory is used to store the SQLite database file when running in Docker.

The database file (`wa_gateway.db`) will be created automatically on first run.

## Docker Volume Mount

When using Docker, this directory is mounted as a volume to persist data:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./db:/app/db
```

This ensures your database persists even when containers are stopped or removed.
